This code demonstrates the use of the strategy design pattern while writing code for data science applications. The pattern gives you the flexibility to choose the desired algorithm at runtime without the specific details about how the algorithm is implemented. The set of related algorithms are encapulated in separate classes for which object are created at runtime. In this example, the user can choose between the type of features(unigrams or bigrams) needed for training a model and the objects of the respective classes are created accordingly.
