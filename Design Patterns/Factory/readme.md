This is a demostration of the use of the factory design pattern in data science applications. It is often not required to create concrete implemetations of classes until runtime to provide a more generic interface to the user. In this example, the abstract class that provides a method for preprocessing data can be implemented by the specific subclasses that can apply One Hot encodeing or Label encoding to the data. The factory method for encoding creates objects for the specific encoder.
